22: holding right+up then pressing left makes the ship jiggle when held in place, guess it doesn't really matter

4: change Player code to fix the mess of x_in_bounds, boosting and the order it checks everything
    currently it does a manual in bounds check before changing position, then later does a check that updates the
    x_in_bounds variable. create the x_in_bounds variable in the first (or do away with it entirely) and re-use in second,
    and do away with the separate function entirely

4b: see whether  def get_direction_and_rotate_player_sprite(self):
    has a smarter way of dealing with these inputs, looks ugly as it is


5: look at the order of the image and .get_rect, it may be wrong, and can use this to change size of collision rects
without making separate variable for it? done for player - perhaps don't need for enemies? can try and see how it feels.
     e.g. make the twirler a very thin rect

14: # later edit self.rect  for enemies, more forgiving hitbox? especially with twirlers
