
currently undulate() function is working, but the makeshift drawing of enemy sprites:

    for enemy in enemies:
        enemy.undulate()
        enemy.update_on_screen_position((enemy.rect.center[0]-(enemy.sprite_width/2)),enemy.rect.center[1]-(enemy.sprite_height/2))

makes it slowly draw itself into nothingspace, in a way that it gets cut off, which is a little strange.


next: make the seeker move towards the player's location, direct straight line for now.

2: make seeker rotate only horizontally to face direction of player

5: Enemy undulate() cannot account for 360 degree spins, will always rotate back when reaching the limit



0: I need to change all moving of images to moving of rects for collision to work _._
- wasn't too bad, only had to change player's rect. remember to update rects and draw images...


1: create hitboxes to detect enemy hitting player
