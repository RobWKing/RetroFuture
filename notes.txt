
the current way animations are set is that they begin at every 1 second or 0.5 second interval
if a new seeker spawns at these intervals, it won't have any spawn-in animation at all


11: try to fix up player animate(), messy as fuck



3: prettify code, find way to hide excess global variables


5: in player class add self.is_boosting, add to animate() to load different sprites when boosting

6: when creating bullets, create parent class with future child classes in mind for different bullet types

7: create bomb class


9: Twirler's current code can make it twirl out of the map, add limits later

10: wedge enemy who flies across screen like asteroid storm

11: wedge makes announcement on screen in some way, maybe sound

12: flesh out levels to load different backgrounds etc, and for enemies to be spawned inside the level class functions

13: can say len(enemies) == 0 to determine level is finished

14: # later edit self.rect to take from a smaller image to reduce frustration in hitbox detection
