
currently undulate() function is working, but the makeshift drawing of enemy sprites:

    for enemy in enemies:
        enemy.undulate()
        enemy.update_on_screen_position((enemy.rect.center[0]-(enemy.sprite_width/2)),enemy.rect.center[1]-(enemy.sprite_height/2))

makes it slowly draw itself into nothingspace, in a way that it gets cut off, which is a little strange.




next: make the seeker move towards te player's location, direct straight line for now.

3: make seeker rotate only horizontally to face direction of player
